## Prompt

--title "Create Auth JWT Isolation Spec" --stage spec

## Response snapshot

Created the feature specification for authentication, JWT, and user isolation. The spec defines user scenarios, functional requirements, and success criteria for implementing secure user authentication with Better Auth, JWT token management, and user isolation in a multi-user web application.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for authentication system with JWT and user isolation requirements
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs\001-auth-jwt-isolation\spec.md, specs\001-auth-jwt-isolation\checklists\requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to create implementation plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification clearly defines security requirements and user isolation mechanisms needed for multi-user application.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
